# EmoFace
Developed a real-time AI-powered emotion detection system that identifies human emotions such as happy, sad, angry, and neutral by analyzing facial expressions through a webcam. Integrated OpenCV for video capture and face detection, and used a pre-trained deep learning model (CNN) for emotion classification. Built an interactive “web mirror” interface that mirrors the user and displays detected emotions live. Technologies used: Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, Flask (for web interface).
